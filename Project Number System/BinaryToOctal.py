            To convert it to octal number:
                Step 1: Split each three value from backward like
                        1           111            011

                Step 2: Here, we have all splited value having length 3 except one i.e 1 so adding extra two '0's in the front of 1
                        001 to make its length 3

                        Then finally we have,
                            001               111               011

                                    = 3

                Step 4: Append each value from first, second, and third which becomes to 173
